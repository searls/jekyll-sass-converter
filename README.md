# Jekyll (lib)Sass Converter

Let Jekyll build your (lib)Sass and (lib)SCSS! A Sass converter for Jekyll that
depends on libsass via the new [sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby) gem,
as Ruby Sass (i.e. the [sass](https://rubygems.org/gems/sass) gem) is deprecated
and will reach end-of-life in March of 2019.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/searls/jekyll-sassc-converter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/searls/jekyll-sassc-converter)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "jekyll-sass-converter", :git =>
    "https://github.com/searls/jekyll-sassc-converter.git"

This will override the official
[jekyll-sass-converter](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sass-converter).
